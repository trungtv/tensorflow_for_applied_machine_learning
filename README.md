## Some remarks
- This course will provide students with knowledge of Tensorflow and applied machine learning.
- All class assignments will be in Python. The students will be fine if they have programing
experience in a different language.
- The students will have hands-on experiences on the whole process of data preparation, model definition, model training, troubleshooting and optimizing in order to solve real-word problems: image classification, neural language model, and neural machine translation.
